Basic Calculator Program
This project is a simple, command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides an interactive menu for selecting an operation and supports repeated calculations. Itâ€™s built with Python and uses basic functions and loops for functionality.

Features
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division operations
User-friendly input prompts and menu
Input validation to prevent errors from non-numeric input
Option to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program

Input Validation
The program checks for non-numeric inputs and will prompt the user to re-enter values if invalid data is detected.

Code Structure
Functions
addition(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtraction(x, y): Returns the difference of x and y.
multiplication(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
division(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y.
Main Loop
The program uses a while loop to continuously ask the user for an operation and inputs until they choose to exit.

Error Handling
A try-except block ensures that invalid inputs are handled gracefully, displaying a prompt if the user enters a non-numeric value.
